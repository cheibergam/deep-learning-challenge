# Alphabet Soup :: Deep Learning Challenge

### Background

The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures.

Alphabet Soup’s business team provided a CSV file containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:

-   **EIN**  and  **NAME** — Identification columns
-   **APPLICATION_TYPE** — Alphabet Soup application type
-   **AFFILIATION** — Affiliated sector of industry
-   **CLASSIFICATION** —G overnment organization classification
-   **USE_CASE** — Use case for funding
-   **ORGANIZATION** — Organization type
-   **STATUS** — Active status
-   **INCOME_AMT** — Income classification
-   **SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS** — Special considerations for application
-   **ASK_AMT** — Funding amount requested
-   **IS_SUCCESSFUL** — Was the money used effectively

### Technical Requirements

The implementation of this project requires the use of [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip).

## Alphabet Soup

The main objective of this project is to develop a solution using the knowledge on machine learning and neural networks, analysing the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
